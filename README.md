___

This application generates a four page story for the user. Each page is randomly chosen from a pool of various choices, each having different artwork and slightly different text. The user can continue to get a different story to read and look at, or the user can also contribute artwork and text to the pool of pages by submitting links to the art as well as entering the new words for the text. Upon approval by the application's administrator, those pages are added and can be randomly chosen for a story.
